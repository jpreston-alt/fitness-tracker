# [Fitness-Tracker](https://jp-fitness-tracker.herokuapp.com/)

## Description
Fitness Tracker is a full-stack application that allows the user to track and visualize their fitness progress. The user may add to or view their latest workout, or start a new workout where they can enter information about the exercises they completed. Fitness tracker provides the user with a series of charts to view their fitness progress by day, by duration of each exercise, and by pounds lifted. This helps the user vizualize their fitness progress, track their successes, and identify areas for improvement.

My task with this project was to take a pre-built front-end, and turn it into a full-stack application by connecting it with a back-end server and MongoDB database using Mongoose. I made some minor stylistic changes, but overall the front-end structure remained the same. The challenge here was working through someone else's front-end code, to decide what they needed from you on the back-end. It was a great exercise in deciphering others code, and working with with MongoDB and Mongoose.

* If the user wants to begin a new workout press the "New Workout" button.
* Choose an exercise type: Cardio or Resistance.
* Enter relevant information about the exercise into input fields (name, miles, distance, weight, reps, etc.)
* Choose to complete the workout or add another exercise. 
* Once workout is complete the user selects "Complete". Then they are taken back to the home screen where they can view their last workout information.
* User may navigate to the dashboard page to view charts representing their workout progress. Categories include duration of workout by day, duration by exercise type, weight lifted by exercise, and weight lifted by day.

## Directions for Future Development
In the future I think this application would be more useful to the user if they were able to view all of their past workouts, instead of just the last one. I would want them to be able to view a calendar and click on a specifc day and view their workout information for that day. I would also like them to be able to make updates to past workouts, by adding and deleting exercises from a specified workout.
